This is a prerequisite for the NSE data ingestion CLI application.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe database schema has been designed in `database_schema.sql` with the following tables:\n\n### Tables\n\n1. **companies** - Master table for stock symbols and metadata\n   - Stores unique symbols, ISIN codes, series, and company names\n   - Primary key for referencing in daily_prices table\n\n2. **daily_prices** - Daily OHLC and volume data\n   - Stores all daily trading data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, etc.)\n   - Foreign key reference to companies table\n   - Unique constraint on (company_id, trade_date) to prevent duplicates\n\n3. **ingestion_log** - Track data ingestion process and status\n   - Logs all data ingestion attempts with status and error messages\n   - Helps with monitoring and debugging the ingestion process\n\n### Indexes\n- Optimized indexes for common query patterns\n- Fast lookups by symbol, date, and company-date combinations\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Review and validate the database schema design\n- [ ] Test schema creation in SQLite\n- [ ] Add any missing constraints or optimizations\n- [ ] Document the schema with examples\n- [ ] Prepare migration scripts if needed\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nThe schema is designed to:\n- Support efficient upsert operations for daily data\n- Handle duplicate data gracefully\n- Provide audit trail through ingestion_log\n- Scale to handle thousands of stocks over multiple years\n- Support future enhancements (additional data sources, real-time data)\n\n## Files\n- `database_schema.sql` - Complete SQLite schema definition\n\nThis schema will be used by the Rust CLI application in issue #1.","comments":[],"labels":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Database Schema Setup for Stock Market Data"}
